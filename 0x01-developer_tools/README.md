# 0x01. Developer Tools

This project is part of the curriculum of ALX Africa. The main objective is to understand the use and functionality of Developer Tools in different browsers.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General

- **What Developer Tools in your browser are**: Developer Tools, often referred to as DevTools, are a set of tools built directly into browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. They allow web developers to test and probe their websites in real-time.

- **How to open the Developer Tools on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge**: The Developer Tools can typically be opened with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac). Right-clicking an element on the page and selecting "Inspect" will also open the DevTools.

- **How to use the elements tab to edit HTML and CSS**: The Elements tab allows you to see the webpage's HTML and CSS. You can edit these directly in the DevTools for testing purposes.

- **How to audit a page according to the tips suggested by Lighthouse**: Lighthouse is an open-source tool for improving the quality of web pages. It can be run against any web page, public or requiring authentication.

- **How to create and run snippets on a page**: Snippets are small scripts that you can author and execute within the Sources panel of Chrome DevTools. You can use them to save and reuse scripts that are heavy with logic, or that you want to include on many pages.

- **How to get information about files and server configurations**: The Network tab in DevTools provides information about each network operation on a page, including detailed timing data, HTTP request and response headers, cookies, WebSocket data, and more.

- **How to block requests**: You can use the "Request blocking" tab in the Network panel to block or unblock specific requests according to certain patterns.

- **How to know how much JavaScript or CSS is used on a page**: The Coverage tab in Chrome DevTools can help you identify unused JavaScript and CSS code.

- **How to detect 404 issues**: The Network panel in the DevTools can display all the network requests from a page. A 404 status code means that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

- **How to move elements on a webpage**: You can do this by manipulating the HTML in the Elements panel of the DevTools. You can move an element by dragging and dropping it within the Elements panel.
