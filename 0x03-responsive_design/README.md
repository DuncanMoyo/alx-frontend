# 0x03. Responsive Design

This project is part of the curriculum of ALX Africa. It focuses on the principles and techniques of responsive web design.

## Topics Covered

### Mobile-First Design

Mobile-first design is an approach to web design that prioritizes optimal viewing and interaction experiences on mobile devices. It involves designing for the smallest screen first and then progressively enhancing the experience for larger screens.

### Media Queries

Media queries are a feature of CSS that enable webpage content to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. They are a fundamental tool in responsive web design.

### Sizes for Responsive Web Design

There are standard sizes to consider in responsive web design. These include widths of 480px (for mobile), 768px (for tablets), 992px (for small laptops), and 1200px (for laptops and desktops).

### Making a Website Responsive

Making a website responsive involves the use of flexible layouts, flexible images, and cascading style sheet media queries. The goal is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and change the layout accordingly.

### Responsive vs. Adaptive Design

Responsive design aims to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with minimal resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices. Adaptive design, on the other hand, is about creating fixed layouts that automatically adjust to different screen sizes.

### CSS Units for Flexible Elements

There are several CSS units that help make elements flexible. These include percentages (%), viewport width (vw), viewport height (vh), and root em (rem).
